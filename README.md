# notetakingapp
Note application as the name implies is a simple application which allows you to Make new notes, edit them, save them locally, delete them , and view list of notes

* it was built using JavaScript , HTML and CSS

* it uses localStorage as a means to save, retrieve, update and delete notes.

* it offers a simple form of validation that ensures that users cannot just send empty fields as inputs

* the title field cannot be empty 

* if eventually a user tries to save an empty note or a note without a title an error message pops up asking the user to input a note or title as the case maybe.

* it completely saves the titles, texts and dates for each note created at a particular time.

* it runs the full functionalities of bootstrap & jQuery without connection to the internet but all that is needed is a great browser.

* tested on Firefox, Chrome and Safari browsers.
